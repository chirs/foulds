Python 3 tools for preserving soccer website data.

=====

Websites are a valuable data source, but are also prone to disappearing at any time.

This project is dedicated to crawling and preserving website data, as well as transforming that data into computer-readable formats for integration into the soccerstats.us project.

Development was re-started after the redesign of uslsoccer.com, wherein an extremely detailed, but inconsistently formatted resource on United States lower leagues (USL, PDL, Super Y League, NWSL) was removed from the internet. The goal of this website will be to reconstitute that information and to save other websites.

=== Todo ===

This project deals with the problem of size - complete websites can be rather large. 

Research other projects for preserving websites.
